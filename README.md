# 👨‍🍳 Chef

A simple, customizable recipe management app.

A simple FastAPI + SQLAlchemy app + VueJS frontend.
Frontend app is built and bundled together with the python build downloadable from PyPI -> the entire app can be run with a single command.
It's also built as a single container and can be easily hosted (with little tweaks) on GCP Cloud Run.
